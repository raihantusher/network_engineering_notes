# PagP

If you want to configure PAgP you have a number of options you can choose from, an interface can be configured as:

 **On** (interface becomes member of the etherchannel but does not negotiate).
**Desirable** (interface will actively ask the other side to become an etherchannel).
**Auto** (interface will wait passively for the other side to ask to become an etherchannel).
**Off** (no etherchannel configured on the interface).
