# Backbone Fast

Backbone Fast is activated when a designated bridge loses its connection to the root bridge in the topology and when it detects a new root bridge. It essentially bypasses the standard STP timers to speed up the convergence process. It also helps to avoid unnecessary root bridge re-elections.
