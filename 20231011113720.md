# no switchport
The "no switchport" command is used in network configurations on Cisco devices, typically within the context of a Cisco switch interface configuration. It serves to remove the interface from Layer 2 switching mode and instead configures it to operate in Layer 3 routing mode. Here's what it means in more detail:

1.  **Switchport Mode**: By default, Ethernet interfaces on Cisco switches operate as Layer 2 switch ports, which means they are used for forwarding traffic between devices at the data link layer (Layer 2). This is **useful for creating VLANs** and connecting devices **within the same broadcast domain**.
    
2.  **"no switchport" Command**: When you issue the "no switchport" command on a switch interface, you are effectively telling the device to treat the interface as a Layer 3 interface rather than a Layer 2 switch port. This means the interface will operate as a routed (routing) interface, allowing it to perform routing functions.
    
3.  **Routing Configuration**: After configuring an interface with "no switchport," you can assign an IP address to it, enabling it to route traffic between different subnets. This makes the interface capable of routing traffic between different networks or VLANs. You can also apply access control lists (ACLs) and other Layer 3 features to control the routing behavior.
    
4.  **Use Cases**: "no switchport" is typically used when you want a switch interface to function as a router interface, which can be helpful in scenarios where you need to perform routing between different subnets or implement advanced routing features. For example, it's commonly used on Layer 3 switches in enterprise networks.
    

In summary, the "no switchport" command transforms a switch interface into a Layer 3 (routing) interface, enabling it to perform routing functions and allowing it to route traffic between different networks or subnets. This command is valuable in network configurations where routing capabilities are needed on switch interfaces.
